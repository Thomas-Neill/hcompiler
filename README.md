# H
An incomplete functional programming language.
See fibs.h for an working example.

## TO-DO (sorted by difficulty):
* --Greater/lesser equals--
* External functions
* String literals
* Currying
* ADTs
* Polymorphism

It's called H because it has 1/7 (probably less) of the functionality of Haskell.
