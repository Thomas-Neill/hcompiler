# H
An incomplete functional programming language.
See fibs.h for an working example.

## TO-DO (sorted by difficulty):
* String/list literals
* void and 'do' (but not the real kind just a way to chain side-effectful functions)
* 'raw' interface with C functions to return manually created unions.

It's called H because it has 1/7 (probably less) of the functionality of Haskell.
